        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>I’ve worked on a broad range of projects from actor pages to business websites. My experience has lead me to believe that three key factors produce a satisfied client: (1) <em>Listening</em>, (2) <em>Researching</em>, and (3) <em>Applying</em>. Listening carefully to a client’s goals and concerns helps me establish a clear understanding of the client’s needs and timeline. Researching the client's industry or the niche the client is pursuing offers clues about industry standards and the type of audience expected to visit the website. Applying the clues learned from careful listening and good research helps me carve out an effective look, feel and tone that will both satisfy the client and attract visitors.  And once this is a achieved, we do it again because this arena is ever-changing.</p>

<p>I have been providing design and project solutions for my small-business clients for over a decade and through that experience I gathered a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.  I specialize in responsive websites, content management systems and customized online stores. I personally strive for both quality and affordability in my work and endeavor to add immediate and long-term value to a client's business using smart solutions and creating eye-catching designs.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>The business of turning a client's vision into an engaging and aesthetically pleasing web design arises as no easy task.  From conception to the final adjustments, creating a successful site demands an understanding of the user expectations. As a designer, I interpret the palette of my prospective, small-business clients and coincide it with the ever-changing demands of a modern internet audience in a digital environment where trends and technology vary from year to year.</p>

		<p>The sites I create are WordPress and custom themes designed to the client's expectations. Furthermore, I ensure that client sites are fully compatible with the most popular internet browsers such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IOS and Android to give the website the broadest audience reach.</p>

		<p>I understand the ins and outs of HTML, XHTML, SQL, JavaScript, CSS and PHP. I also make it a point to pay close attention to detail, which leads to less website malfunctions and browser incompatibility down the road.</p>
